did not properly handle upgrade requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 in
some situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (daemon crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-0197)

Craig Young discovered that a memory overwrite error existed in
Apache when performing HTTP/2 very early pushes in some situations. A
remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04.
(CVE-2019-10081)

Craig Young discovered that a read-after-free error existed in the
HTTP/2 implementation in Apache during connection shutdown. A remote
attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. This issue only
affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-10082)

Matei Badanoiu discovered that the mod_proxy component of
Apache did not properly filter URLs when reporting errors in some
configurations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2019-10092)

Daniel McCarney discovered that mod_remoteip component of Apache
contained a stack buffer overflow when parsing headers from a trusted
intermediary proxy in some situations. A remote attacker controlling a
trusted proxy could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly
execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.
(CVE-2019-10097)

Yukitsugu Sasaki discovered that the mod_rewrite component in Apache
was vulnerable to open redirects in some situations. A remote attacker
could use this to possibly expose sensitive information or bypass
intended restrictions. (CVE-2019-10098)

Jonathan Looney discovered that the HTTP/2 implementation in Apache did
not properly limit the amount of buffering for client connections in
some situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service (unresponsive daemon). This issue only affected Ubuntu
18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-9517)");
