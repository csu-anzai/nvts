It was discovered that pressing certain key combinations could bypass
addon installation prompt delays. If a user opened a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to trick them in to
installing a malicious extension. (CVE-2019-11697)

It was discovered that history data could be exposed via drag and drop
of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks. If a user were tricked in to dragging
a specially crafted hyperlink to the bookmark toolbar or sidebar, and
subsequently back in to the web content area, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11698)

A type confusion bug was discovered with object groups and UnboxedObjects.
If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website after
enabling the UnboxedObjects feature, an attacker could potentially
exploit this to bypass security checks. (CVE-2019-9816)");
